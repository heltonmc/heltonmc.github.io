## Bio

Hi! I am a [current PhD student](https://lsa.umich.edu/appliedphysics/people/graduate-students/michael-helton.html) in Applied Physics at the University of Michigan.
My research focuses on developing computational methods for modeling light transport in biological media from optical measurements such
as [NIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy) and [DCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusing-wave_spectroscopy).

I have a particular passion for developing and optimizing accurate and efficient numerical routines with particular interest on special mathematical functions. The following are projects that I have helped develop.
* [Bessels.jl](https://github.com/heltonmc/Bessels.jl): _Algorithms for computation of Bessel's functions_
* [LightPropagation.jl](https://github.com/heltonmc/LightPropagation.jl): _Modeling light transport in turbid media_
* [Laplace.jl](https://github.com/heltonmc/Laplace.jl): _A collection of routines for numerical inversion of the Laplace transform_
* [Struve.jl](https://github.com/gwater/Struve.jl): _Algorithms for computing Struve functions_

I am currently seeking employment opportunites after I graduate in December 2022. I have extensive computational experience using Julia, C/C++, and Matlab with a focus on CPU optimization. Please [reach out](https://heltonmc.github.io/about/#contact) about any prospective job opportunities.
