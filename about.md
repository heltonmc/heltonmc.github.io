## Bio

Hi! I am a [current PhD student](https://lsa.umich.edu/appliedphysics/people/graduate-students/michael-helton.html) in Applied Physics at the University of Michigan.
My research is on developing computational tools for modeling light transport in biological media from optical measurements such
as [NIRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy) and [DCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusing-wave_spectroscopy)
with a particular focus on the time-domain.

I have a particular passion for developing and optimizing accurate and efficient numerical routines.

* [Bessels.jl](https://github.com/heltonmc/Bessels.jl): _Algorithms for computation of Bessel's functions_
* [Laplace.jl](https://github.com/heltonmc/Laplace.jl): _A collection of routines for numerical inversion of the Laplace transform_
